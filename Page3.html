        <p>I want to be a business woman.</p>
        <p>I want to help my family financially for the future.
            I want to be like Dato Sri Vida.
            She is a successful business woman. She is very committed in business dealings.
            She did not give up despite being insulted, criticized, evilly envied by others.</p>
        <br> <br>

        <h4> This is about Dato Sri Vida</h4>
        <p>Dato Seri Hasmiza Othman, popularly known as Dato Sri Vida, is one of the most successful businesswomen in Malaysia. She is known for establishing her own empire of cosmetics and health business, Vida Beauty, and its famous product, Qu Puteh.</p>
        <p>The circumstances of losing her father led Vida to learn how to be independent and she found early in her life that she could support herself by running her own business. Even when she was still in school, she learned to make her own pocket money by selling packed meals to her friends. This continued all the way until she went to university, where she not only sold products to her peers and teachers, but also took up part-time jobs to support herself.</p>
        <p>When she graduated from Universiti Sains Malaysia with a degree in education, Vida got herself a steady stream of monthly income as a teacher. It was then that she took the opportunity to learn about the beauty and grooming field and ventured into the business.</p>
