        <h1>MY FUTURE PLANS</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p>For future planning, I will work for a while to fill my free time after finishing my industrial training. After that, I will work at a company that offers me a job.</p>
        <p> If only no one offered me a job, I would pursue my dream of becoming an entrepreneur until I succeed. Itâ€™s to supplement my finances and family.</p>
        <p>Once in business, I will fulfill all the needs and wants of my parents. Because they have raised and educated me to be a useful human being in the future.</p>
